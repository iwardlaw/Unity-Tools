# Unity Tools #

This repository houses various tools I've created for use in Unity.

- The **Magnetic Walls** tool allows players to walk on walls and ceilings by altering their source of gravity.

- The **Waypoint Graph** tool facilitates object movement among a set of user-defined points.

- The **Worldspace Textbox** tool delivers text-based interactions in world space instead of screen space. Necessary for using textboxes in head-mounted-display-based virtual reality.
