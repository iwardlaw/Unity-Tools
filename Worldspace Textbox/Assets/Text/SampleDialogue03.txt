GREY CUBE: They say a dollar a day keeps the doctor away.
::

PLAYER: Is that true?
::

GREY CUBE: I think it is.,,
However, I've found that dollars don't taste particularly good.,,
That's why I only eat cheeseburgers now.
::

PLAYER: How's that working out?
::

GREY CUBE: I feel terrible.,, All the time.,,
But I haven't seen any doctors.
::

PLAYER: Is it possible that you just haven't gone to see any? Doctors don't hunt their patients down, you know?
::

GREY CUBE: ...,,....,,
I need help, don't I?
::

PLAYER: Yes. Yes you do.
